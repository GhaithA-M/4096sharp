# 4096sharp
4096sharp is challenging puzzle game inspired by the classic 2048, but with a twist. This game extends the traditional gameplay by incorporating an 8x8 grid, making it much more difficult.

## How to Play
Merge tiles with the same number by moving them in one of four directions (up, down, left, right). Each move adds 4 new tiles to the grid. Combine tiles to reach the 4096 tile without filling up the grid.

Controls are **WASD** or **arrow keys**

**R** = Reset game

**ESC** = Exit game

Developed in C# using the Microsoft XNA Framework (Monogame) in Visual Studio Community 2022.
